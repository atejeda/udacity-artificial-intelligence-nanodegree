# this is convince myself.
# this can allow to remove all values from the values[peer]
# in case that values[peer] contains only the values[k] (digit)
# means that len(values[peer] can be 0
# e.g.: A1  B2  C3
# 1)    1   123 123
# 2)    1   23  23 # 1 removed by elimination
# 3) assume that in B2 and C3 columns, 3 was removed by elimination
# 4)    1   2   2
# 5) in the next search/iteration the 2 in C3 will be eliminated
#    causing inconsistency in the sudoku, and if a check is implemented
#    e.g.: if len(values[peer]) > 1
#    before the assign value, the sudoku will keep 2 twice, which is a
#    contradictiona as well
